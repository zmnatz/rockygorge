## Class of 2017

### Tom "Odie" Owens
As the founding father of Rocky Gorge, Tom "Odie" was inducted into the RG Hall of Fame in 2014. Owens began his rugby career playing as a prop for four semesters at Frostburg before he was expelled from school. After not finding a club to his liking, Owens and a group of friends founded Rocky Gorge in 1986 and became the club's first President. After playing scrumhalf for ten years, Owen's final season of senior men's club was 1996, but continued to play with the Gorge Old Boys until 2004.

Starting Rocky Gorge was Owens' biggest accomplishment. "I see how many people it has affected their lives. People have gotten jobs through the club, careers, marriages, divorces. People have made life long friends. To meet and have connections through the culture of rugby. When I see that the current guys are so successful, I can't believe that I was part of all of it."

### Jim Hulbert
Jimmy Hulbert was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2015. Hulbert started playing in college at Salisbury from 1985 to 1989 as a hooker and loose forward. Jim joined Columbia RFC in 1990 after college playing the same positions. As the president of Columbia RFC during the merge, Hulbert was pivotal in the discussions and worked with Owens and other to finalize the merger.

Jim's major accomplishment was taking over coaching and administering the Howard County Hurricanes Youth Organization in 2001, and has continued those duties with the Hurricanes for 16 years. Hulbert was integral in establishing and promoting youth rugby in Howard County. Rocky Gorge has provided coaching and support to the Hurricanes and players such as Matt Burns, Cordell Drummond, and Brandon Drummond have come back to Gorge to play for the men's club. In addition, two other players have gone on to play in the College Rugby Championships.

### Clarence Culpepper
As a legendary coach of Rocky Gorge from 2000 to 2007, Clarence Culpepper was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2015. Before becoming Gorge's head coach, Culpepper played linebacker for Virginia Tech and suited up for the Roanoke RFC before being capped twice as a USA Eagle in 1977 and 1978. Culpepper's coaching career began in 1980 spanning multiple clubs in the Mid-Atlantic. Clarence was such highly regarded as a coach that he was tapped to call the shots for the USA National Team in 1990 and 1992. In addition to RG's Hall of Fame, Culpepper has also been inducted into the Virginia Rugby Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia-Whitemarsh Hall of Fame.

Beginning in 2000 as head coach, Culpepper was an intense coach and responsible for turning Gorge into a rugby powerhouse with his brand of "Machine Rugby". Clarence's taught a forwards-oriented philosophy to keep recycling the ball and hitting.

## Class of 2019

### Dave Eisenberg
Dave Eisenberg was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. Eisenberg began playing at Frostburg from 1985-1987 and joined Gorge in spring 1989. Playing fullback, flyhalf, and as a utility player, Dave kicked points for Gorge from 1989 to 1995 and earned team MVP honors in 1991. He continued to play for Gorge until 2003 and started the GODS (Gorge Old Dudes) Old Boys team in 1999. In addition to being the match secretary at the time of the club merger, Eisenberg was the team president from 1993-1995.

Known to be a great player and club man, Dave has been immortalized by Rocky Gorge in song, "Dave Eisenberg, Dave Eisenberg, how we love you Dave Eisenburg!"

### Tom Henry
Tom Henry was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018. Tom played at Gettysburg College from 1986-1989 as a flanker and joined Columbia RFC in 1990 as a flanker. Henry continued to play through the merger as a fixture at outside center until retiring in 2007. Tom still plays Old Boy rugby to this day. In addition to his feats on the pitch, Tom has been a major monetary contributor to the club.

Henry was the leading scorer for Gorge for many years being in the right place at the right time and being a good finisher. "My best trait was being able to read the other team in order to break through a hole or pick off a pass," Henry said. "No matter what, I gave 100% all of the time. The fun part of rugby was that we always had 15 guys to hang out with, to play with, and go out afterwards. As I look back, most of my accomplishments are social. I made so many long term friends."

### Chuck Moore
Chuck Moore was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018. As an extraordinary player and selfless in his passion for Rocky Gorge, Moore played rugby from 1990-1994 at Frostburg as an eightman. After college, Chuck joined Gorge in January 1995 playing almost every position in the forwards and was captain for four years. While playing, Moore became a Gorge assistant coach under Culpepper and once Culpepper left at the end of the 2005-2006 season, Chuck became head coach for the next season.

Chuck was witness to the maturation of Gorge and was vital to leading to the club's first national championship taking on many roles in the team leadership. Under his leadership Gorge won the 2012 DII National Championship. Moore said that his biggest accomplishment was "getting Gorge serious and organized. Taking Gorge from a social drinking team to a serious club, but likes to have fun." After the 2012-2013 season, Moore stepped down as head coach, but is still involved in the Gorge 7s program and Capital Select Side.

## Class of 2022

### Greg Florenzo
Greg Florenzo played in the forwards for Rocky Gorge RFC from 1988 to 2003 and with the GODs from 1999 to 2011. Although he usually played as a loose forward, he filled in at lock and prop when called upon. He was known for his quick wit both on and off the field and the bone-crushing hits upon opponents. He was instrumental in Gorge winning the PRU DII during the 1991 and 1995 seasons, and was named Co-MVP in 1995. Greg continued to grow rugby and expand Rocky Gorge community relations through his coaching with the Howard County Hurricanes. He was always committed to raising funds for Gorge through his tremendous work ethic, extensive networking skills, and his many generous donations. Greg lived his life to the fullest and always played to the final whistle. Unfortunately, Greg passed away in 2017 from cancer.

### Vince “Monroe” Michalski
Vince has been the very fabric of our club for many years. Aside from his career on the pitch, he has been a force away from it as well. He began as a flanker in 1991 and played his final season as a second row in 2011. He was selected to the 1997 PRU Select Side and the MARFU Select Side in 2007. He also played in the Ambassador Shield Matches in 2007-2008. He was a club Secretary from 1992-1994 and Vice President from 2008-2013. He traveled with the Gorge international tours to England in 2003 and Ireland in 2007. He was a friend to all and affectionately nicknamed "Monroe". His most infamous line came during the Ireland Tour in Limerick: "Hey, it's really great to see all you Irish guys in the shower with us." Vince has been and continues to be a bonding ingredient that networks throughout our club and continues to nurture this special fraternity that is Rocky Gorge Rugby.

### William “Billy” Weeks
After playing mostly in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to start his career, Billy began playing for Rocky Gorge in 2000. Over the years, he has played multiple positions from flanker to a strong asset in the backline. Billy seemed to be most comfortable and make the largest impact when slotted at fullback where he used his increbile speed and field awareness. He hung up his boots in 2011 after contributing his talents to the team's first National Playoff appearance. Since his retirement, he has been contributing to the club as Rocky Gorge's official representative within the Referees Society.

### Pete “3Pete” Ressler
What can you say about a little guy that came out to a men's club when he was 17 or 18 and weighed about 135 pounds wearing some stupid no-sleeve Aussie Rules shirt, but with no accent? Normally you would say this guy will be done in a few weeks. Well, you mustn't know Pete. He finished the summer and went to college at St. Mary's. Each year in college he got better and came back each summer to play with Gorge and went back even better. It was a wonderful cycle of improvement driven by heart and skill, but he never seemed to grow. Finally, he came to us full-time and became a large part of Rocky Gorge. Willing to play any position and with the heart of a much larger man, he excelled in the backs. Finally, he starting working out with some of the gym guys and what do you know, he put on like ten pounds! So armed with the new muscles, he became a leader on Gorge in a time when things were not going as planned. He stuck with us and helped us get on a winning track. He was essential in our ascendance as a rugby powerhouse. He became our flyhalf and was as fierce of a competitor as you will find anywhere. Go back and watch some of the highlights in the early 2010s and you will notice it is Pete setting up just about everything. In 2012, he was massive for getting us into and through the playoffs. This little guy played with a torn up knee and totally embarrassed some of the best clubs in the country in 2012. Some guys from Minnesota and from Montauk are still cursing his name. We would not have won those games without some of the plays he made. Unfortunately, his season ended due to that knee. At training right before the Final Four, his knee that must have been held together by lots of athletic tape, several braces, and hope, finally gave way. He still supported the club and became the drunkest man in Denver. Once he healed he came back and led the club to the second national championship in 2014. Again making some amazing plays and showing that you don't have to be big to be great at rugby. His last game was the 2014 National Championship.

### Sean Kelley
Sean Kelley was a player of exceptional skill and pace. Decent size for a #8, but what set him apart was his long-ranging try-scoring runs that seemed to happen every match. He was a nightmare for defenses as not only could he run around the fastest backs but through the largest of props; that is if one were silly enough to get in his way. He was part of the original Salisbury crew that came out in 2008. He always brought a positive attitude to the team, and of course, was always good for a laugh. He also coined the phrase “Shawk” which would be a flying shark with talons. He was great for the team right from the start and we began winning games we would not have won before when he arrived. He became a leader and a role model for young players. They had to work out harder to try and keep up with him in training. His last start for the Gorge was the 2012 National Championship where he led from the front as always. For the current players, he was the type of player that kept Josh Brown on the bench in 2012. I think Josh will agree that is not a knock on him but a testament to Sean.

### Andrew “Air Force” Kendall
Andrew Kendall played rugby at Salisbury University from 2004 to 2009 amassing several Best Back and MVP Awards through the seasons. Midway through his college tenure, he began playing summer 7s with Rocky Gorge and upon graduation, became a full-time fixture with the club. While he was not the first, nor the last Salisbury alum to join Gorge, his fiery competitiveness raised the level of play among everyone that stepped onto the pitch with him. His ball-handling and kicking prowess from the fullback position helped propel Gorge onto the national stage. He was a key member of the teams that made it to the national playoffs for most of his time with the club. In the run-up to the 2012 National Championship, “Air Force” led the team to more than five, second-half, come-from-behind victories. His on-field play in the 2012 National Championship match was nothing short of miraculous. His well-timed and placed kicks in conjunction with his goal-kicking ability routinely left Wisconsin on the back foot, and ultimately resulted in another comeback win. He was rightfully recognized as the MVP for the 2012 National Championship.
